# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section documents all major technical decisions for the Ohana Booking System.

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision Drivers**: Key factors influencing the decision
- **Options Considered**: Alternatives we evaluated
- **Decision**: What we chose and why
- **Consequences**: Positive outcomes, negative tradeoffs, and risks
