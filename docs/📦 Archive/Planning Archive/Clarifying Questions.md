# Clarifying Questions

## Quick Clarifying Questions

Before we design the MVP, I need to understand a few more things:

**1. About "Bookkeeping":**
When you say bookkeeping takes too much time, do you mean:

- a) Tracking payments (deposits, final payments, what's owed)?
    - Yes, currently tracking it on the spreadsheet where I keep track of bookings
- b) Just organizing/entering booking information?
    - This included
- c) Actual accounting/taxes stuff?
    - This is not a priority for now

**2. About Quotes & Packages:**

- Do most clients pick a standard package, or is everything custom-negotiated?
    - There are standard packages, but open to negotiation
- What % of inquiries convert to actual bookings? (rough guess)
    - 20% - If I’m quoting on an inquiry I was auto-added on TheBash/GigSalad
    - 60% - Others, or if I was contacted directly for a quote on TheBash/GigSalad
- Do you send formal quotes/contracts, or just email with price?
    - Typically I send a price list pdf

**3. After Deposit, Before Event:**

- Once they pay deposit and it's confirmed, what happens between then and the event date?
    - Clarify any specific details with clients
    - Send performers an email with the information (date, address, performers, time, collect deposit, special requests, event type)
    - Discuss show lineup and costumes
- Do you send reminder emails? Run sheets? Anything that needs tracking?
    - I don’t send reminder emails, I send the detail info the week of/before the event. I sometimes follow up on performers if they’re still booked (making sure they remember) via text.

**4. Performer Workflow:**

- When you text/email performers to check availability, do they usually respond quickly?
    - Typically within the day. Sometimes immediate - it varies.
- Do they need to see booking details (address, special requests) before accepting?
    - Mainly time and location (city is typically enough)
- Right now, do they track their own schedules, or rely on your emails?
    - Their track their own schedules

**5. The "Starting Over" Situation:**

- You mentioned starting over - does that mean you're rebuilding the business?
    - I disregarded my business over a few years ignoring calls and emails, it became inactive. Currently have 1 repeat client, we lost the rest. We still get emails/calls during the busier season.
- Should we design for 5 events/month now, or plan for 40-60/year once ramped up?
    - Isn’t 5 events/month the same as 40-60/year? This should work whether there’s 50 bookings in a year, or in a month.
