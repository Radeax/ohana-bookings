### **1. Project Purpose and Justification**

Ohana of Polynesia currently manages event bookings, performer schedules, and client communications through a fragmented system of Google Sheets, texts, emails, and third-party platforms. This approach causes inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and potential scheduling conflicts.

**This project aims to develop a custom web app that centralizes and streamlines all booking, inquiry, and scheduling operations, enabling better organization, communication, and business scalability.**

---

### **2. Objectives**

- **Centralize** all client inquiries, bookings, and performer availability in a single platform.
- **Streamline** the process of responding to client inquiries and checking performer schedules.
- **Reduce manual effort** and errors by automating reminders and confirmations.
- **Provide reporting** for business performance and utilization.
- **Lay the foundation** for future enhancements (invoicing, performer portal, analytics).

---

### **3. High-Level Requirements**

- **Admin dashboard** to view/manage all inquiries, bookings, and schedules.
- **Inquiry capture** from website forms and (eventually) third-party platforms.
- **Performer management:** Assign, confirm, and track performer availability and bookings.
- **Client communication:** Track correspondence, send confirmations (future: automated reminders).
- **Payment tracking:** (Phase 2) Record deposits, payments, and outstanding balances.
- **Reporting:** Simple metrics on bookings and revenue.
