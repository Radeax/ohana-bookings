# Meeting Notes #6: Development Plan

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Attendees:** Joven Poblete

**Purpose:** Create detailed week-by-week implementation roadmap

---

## Phase 1 Overview

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Hours/Week:** 30-40 hours

**Approach:** Backend-first (complete API, then build frontend)

**Goal:** Ship production-ready admin MVP

---

## Key Decisions

### Backend-First Strategy

**Rationale:**

- Solid foundation - API fully tested before UI
- No context switching - focus on one layer at a time
- Better testing - can use Postman/Thunder Client
- Clear contracts - API shapes finalized before frontend
- Confidence - know everything works before building UI

### Timeline Breakdown

- **Weeks 1-2:** Complete backend (API + database)
- **Week 2.5:** API polish + frontend setup
- **Week 3:** Frontend core features
- **Week 4:** Frontend polish + production deployment

---

## Updated Schema Requirements

### User/Performer Relationship (CRITICAL)

**Discovery:** Owner is both admin AND performer

- Users can have MULTIPLE roles via array
- Example: `roles: ['admin', 'coordinator', 'performer']`
- Users can be linked to performer records via `performer_id`
- Performers can be linked to users via `user_id` (bidirectional)

**Phase 1:**

- Owner: User with all roles + linked to performer record
- External performers: Performer records without user accounts

**Phase 1.5:**

- Create user accounts for performers
- Link via `user_id`
- Enable performer portal

### Financial Model (REVISED)

**Two-Level Tracking:**

1. **Business Level (Admin View)**

   ```
   Revenue = Client payments
   Business Expenses = Performer payouts + Overhead
   Business Profit = Revenue - Expenses
   ```

2. **Performer Level (Personal View)**

   ```
   Gross Pay = Payouts received
   Personal Expenses = Gas, food, parking (own costs)
   Net Take-Home = Gross Pay - Personal Expenses
   ```

**Key Insight:** Performer expenses are NOT reimbursements. They are personal costs performers track for their own profit calculation.

### New Tables Added

1. **performer_expenses** (NEW)
   - Tracks performer personal gig costs
   - Separate from payouts
   - Phase 1: Admin can log for anyone
   - Phase 1.5: Performers log their own
2. **overhead_expenses** (BACK IN SCOPE)
   - Business-level costs (costumes, equipment, subscriptions)
   - Admin only
   - Categories: costumes, equipment, subscriptions, marketing, props, other

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Risks:**

1. **Scope creep** - Adding features during development
   - _Mitigation:_ Stick to the plan, document Phase 2 ideas
2. **Backend taking longer than 2 weeks**
   - _Mitigation:_ Use AI copilot, reference past NestJS project
3. **Complexity in financial calculations**
   - _Mitigation:_ Write tests for calc logic, validate with real scenarios
4. **Deployment issues**
   - _Mitigation:_ Deploy to staging early (Week 2.5), fix issues before production

---

## Next Actions

1. Set up development environment (Docker, monorepo)
2. Start Week 1: Project setup
3. Create GitHub repo
4. Begin backend implementation

**Status:** Ready to begin development üöÄ
