# Session 1: Domain & Problem Space

Let's understand what you're really dealing with. Answer honestly based on how things work **today**, not how you wish they worked.

## Part 1: The Business

**1. What does Ohana of Polynesia do?**

- What type of events do you perform at? (weddings, corporate, festivals?)
    - All types - weddings, corporate, festivals, birthdays, retirement homes, anniversaries, just because, annual gatherings, etc.
- What's the performance? (hula dancers, fire performers, cultural shows?)
    - Polynesian variety show showcasing dances from Hawaii, Tahiti, New Zealand, Fijia, and/or Samoa. Length varies but typically 45-60min of service. Fire performance depends on client budget and venue.
- How many events per month on average?
    - Roughly 40-60 per year, right now we’re starting over.
    - Here are our past bookings: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HM4pCznOX44pelk1zzkYUUKz2QTV1IVTNcNvnSPr9-M/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HM4pCznOX44pelk1zzkYUUKz2QTV1IVTNcNvnSPr9-M/edit?usp=sharing)

**2. Who handles what?**

- Are you the only admin, or are there others?
    - There’ll be another. Might need a role for someone who does the booking, but can’t might be restricted from viewing certain info.
- How many performers in your roster?
    - Right now, ~3-4
- Do performers have any say in which gigs they take, or do you assign them?
    - I assign them, but they take it based on their own decision/availability

## Part 2: Current Workflow (The Messy Reality)

Walk me through what happens **today** when someone wants to book Ohana:

**3. Inquiry comes in:**

- Where do inquiries come from? (website form, email, phone, GigSalad, The Bash?)
    - The come from all. Direct/indirect inquiries on GigSalad/TheBash where I need to bid against other companies. I do get emails and phone calls. Website form too after the site is rebuilt.
- What happens when you get an inquiry? (where do you write it down?)
    - I don’t keep track of all inquiries, I keep it where the inquiry was created (e.g., GigSalad inbox, TheBash inbox, email, etc)

**4. You qualify and quote:**

- How do you check if performers are available for that date?
    - Typically I text or email them. Sometimes ask them verbally first.
- How do you decide on pricing?
    - There’s standard packages but might increase/decrease for specific clients. Same with the performer pay, but I’m trying to change it where I stick to more a predictable rate.
- How do you send quotes? (email? phone?)
    - I reply to their email or message on a platform. If by phone I give them a quote but typically finalize it via email.

**5. They want to book:**

- What info do you need to collect?
    - **Date, Time, Address, Occasion, Day-of-Event Contact, Contact Phone #, Invoice Addressee**
- How do you confirm performers for that date?
    - They tell me yes. Booking is final once client pays a deposit
- Where do you track that it's booked?
    - Google sheets, linked earlier

**6. Leading up to the event:**

- How do performers know about their gigs?
    - They’re responsible for keeping track, but typically I sent an email with detailed info
- How do you track what they need to know? (location, time, special requests)
    - In the email I send before the event
- Do clients ever change details last minute?
    - Sometimes

## Part 3: Pain Points

**7. What breaks or frustrates you most?**

- Have you ever double-booked a performer?
    - Yes, but rarely.
- Do you lose track of inquiries?
    - Sometimes
- Is it hard to remember who you quoted vs. who actually booked?
    - Sometimes, but I usually don’t keep track of quotes. It’s in the inbox
- What takes the most time that shouldn't?
    - Bookkeeping

**8. What happens when things go wrong?**

- Give me an example of a recent mistake or near-miss
    - I forget to respond to clients
- What would have prevented it?
    - Reminders, higher visibility

## Part 4: Success Vision

**9. Six months from now, if this app is working perfectly:**

- What does your Monday morning look like?
    - I check my app, can see any new inquiries and the status of current bookings. I’ll get notifications as updates come along (new inquiries, performer accepted, etc.)
- What are you NOT doing anymore?
    - Relying on Google Sheets as my main source of truth
    - Not having to text performers directly if they’re available for an event
- What's easier/faster?
    - Confirming a booking and looking at data

**10. What's the ONE thing that, if we fixed it, would make the biggest difference?**

- Having a way to automatically take inquiries and provide quotes if they’re ok with the standard packages/offerings
